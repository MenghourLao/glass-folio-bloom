      # ‚ö†Ô∏è Ticket Sale Challenges

      ## 1. High-Traffic Load & Queueing

      - **Issue**: 2 million+ session attempts caused queue and blank screens.
      - **Cause**: Server scaled 4 to 20 instances, but payment latency (5 mins) caused blockage.
      - **Solution**: Temporary fixes applied; some delays still occurred.

      ## 2. Overbooking & Payment Mismatches

      - **Problem**: Users paid but didn't receive tickets.
      - **Cause**: Sync issues between payment & ticket inventory.
      - **Solution**: Manual refunds totaling $33,390 across 235 transactions.

      # üèõ Check-in System & Fraud Prevention

      ## Crew Preparation:

      - ASK Orientation held on Sep 13, 2024 at Raintree.
      - Training on:
        - **Offline QR Code Scanning** (Operator Mode)
        - **Pre-check Validations** (phone #, seat color)
        - **Wristband Distribution** handover to Heng Meas crew

      ## Site Layout:

      - Assigned gates: VIP, Premium, Standard, Standing, Standard+
      - Crew divided into check-in & pre-check teams with clear roles
      - Staff briefing at 7:30 AM; staggered lunch breaks

      ## Customer Experience:

      - Staff trained to smile, assist, and remain calm under pressure

      # üîê Manual Ticket Verification

      - **New Ticket Design**: Updated artwork a day before to avoid replication.
      - **Phone Match Rule**: Last 3 digits used to verify identity.
      - **Side Effect**: Some delays due to attendees not knowing the rule.

      # üìç Final Preparations

      - **CCTV**: Installed 1 day before for fraud deterrence
      - **Crew Training**: Rushed but covered essentials; future events require longer lead time

      # üö´ Service & Marketing Limitations

      ## Customer Support:

      - Understaffed during ticket crisis
      - Recommendation: Create a dedicated support team for high-pressure moments

      ## Marketing Shortfall:

      - Limited pre-event engagement
      - Recommendation:
        - Teasers, BTS content, live updates during ticketing
        - Real-time social media crisis messaging

      # üìà Key Recommendations for Organizers

      ## 1. Infrastructure Scalability

      - Notify users in queue of estimated wait times
      - Coordinate with payment gateway for standby tech support

      ## 2. Fraud & Transfer Solution

      - Enable digital ticket transfers to simplify and secure ownership changes

      ## 3. Peak Traffic UX Enhancements

      - Real-time status indicators
      - Virtual queue with estimated wait time
      - Auto-refresh for availability & capacity

      # ‚úÖ Conclusion

      The Q ‚Äì Rise of The Queen was BookMe+'s **largest and most demanding** concert to date. It tested our infrastructure and operations under high traffic and complex logistics.

      Despite facing system load issues and manual coordination demands, we:

      - Checked in 98.7% of all ticket holders
      - Recovered from a multi-million session spike

      # The Challenge

      Harmony Wellness Center is a holistic health facility that houses multiple practitioners including massage therapists, acupuncturists, nutritionists, and yoga instructors. With 15 practitioners sharing 8 treatment rooms, their manual booking system was causing:

      BookMe+ implemented a customized scheduling system that:

      - Created individual practitioner profiles with their specialties and availability
      - Automated room allocation based on treatment type and availability
      - Sent automated appointment reminders via email and SMS
      - Enabled clients to book appointments online 24/7

      # The Results

      After six months of using BookMe+, Harmony Wellness Center saw:

      - 35% increase in bookings

      - No-show rate decreased from 22% to 8%
      - Client satisfaction scores improved by 28%
      - Room utilization increased by 40%

      The center was able to redirect administrative resources to marketing efforts and client experience improvements, resulting in additional revenue growth.
